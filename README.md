## Usage

Run the [main.m](https://github.com/isro01/cs637_project/blob/main/core/main.m) file to run the iterations ( number of iterations can be changed by setting the value of N in the SimParams.m file )

For plotting the trajectories, use " x_log, y_log " variables for optimal trajecotry and "map.RefTraj" for reference trajectory.
